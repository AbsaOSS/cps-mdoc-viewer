The Overview serves as the initial point for users to get acquainted with your project. It acts as a foundational explanation, offering clarity on what the project is about, why it's crucial, and who it's intended for. Depending on the breadth of your documentation, you may either have a standalone Overview page, like this one, or combine your overview content with the Documentation landing page.

### Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
- [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!
